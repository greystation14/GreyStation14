  # Core Rule 14 - Do not use LOOC or OOC to share current round information
  Local Out of Character (LOOC) and Out of Character (OOC) channel are meant for things that don't relate to the current round. Using these channels to share round info is often referred to as "IC in OOC" or "ick ock".

 (May result in a round ban or ban on antagonistic roles)
  - Use LOOC to tell someone you are an antagonist.
  - Use LOOC to tell someone about your antagonistic goals.
  - Use LOOC to tell someone that your character is not lying.

  Things you could do instead:
  - Use codewords in-character.
  - Try to convince them that you are not lying in-character, or accept that you won't be able to convince them.
